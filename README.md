# Tensorflow-Image-Classification-ASAP
ASAP guide on how to setup Tensorflow/Keras for Image Classification for Windows 10* 

# *Disclaimer*:
This tutorial includes content that can be found online, the goal of this tutorial was to combine the content in order to make it easier for people who are not as good at neural networks but want to see what it's like to use one in the perspective of a person using software to make such programs. What this means is, I went through the work of going through said content in order to make it easier for you to make what this tutorial has to offer and *I do not claim ownership to any of it*. The following content was used in order to make this tutorial:

Video by Jeff Heaton: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfNFz3dRloI) - Installation of Anaconda, Python, Tensorflow and Keras for Pycharm

Video by Chris Dahms: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXpsAiSajE0) - Image-Classification Walkthrough

Image-Recognition by Google (https://github.com/ArunMichaelDsouza/tensorflow-image-detection) - I.R program in the walkthrough

## In this guide, you'll learn how to do the following:

- Setup Pycharm

- Make an anaconda file to store Tensorflow related projects

- Install Tensorflow, OpenCV, and other programs useful for ML/NN

- Create a Tensorflow-Python Interpreter for ML/NN

- Prepare the image classification program.

- Train & test a set of images in order to make your own image classifier.

## What this guide will *Not* teach you:

- Programming with python (Although heres an excellent resource by youtuber Corey Schafer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU)

- How to make your own neural networks (Free course on ML & NN by Google: https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/ml-intro)

- How to use any of the other modules (Searching for a documentation/youtube tutorials should be good enough to learn them)

- Anything else unrelated to this tutorial

# 1) Installing Pycharm:

a) In order you install Pycharm you will need to download it from it's website:
